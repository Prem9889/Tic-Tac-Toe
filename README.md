Tic-Tac-Toe is a classic two-player game where players take turns marking Xs and Os on a 3x3 grid. The
objective is to be the first to form a horizontal, vertical, or diagonal line of three of their own symbols. Simple
yet strategic, Tic-Tac-Toe is a fun and engaging game that challenges players to think ahead and block their
opponentâ€™s moves while aiming to create their own winning line.
